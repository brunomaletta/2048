The game consists on a board, of size K x K, and a numeric base N. By default, K = 2N.
After every move you make, a new number will apear randomly on an empty position of the board. That number can either be N or N^2, N being N times more likely to occur.
In the begining of the game, there is only one number on the board. For example, for N = 2 and K = 4:
A move consists on pressing an arrow key on the keyboard. By doing so, all the numbers on the board will be pulled to the direction you chose.
By pressing the left arrow key on our example:
Note that the number 4 = N^2 appeared on a random position.
Also, when you make a move, N equal numbers lined on the direction of the move will be joined together, so this way you can create bigger numbers. For example:
By pressing left on this stage, you will get:
Note that the number 2 = N on the 3rd line and 4th column appeared randomly.
You lose when the board is completly filled and the there is no available move.
The goal of the game is to obtain the highest score you can.
The score is calculated by the sum of all the numbers on the board, divided by K^2.
